# Shared Resources

The `shared/` directory contains reusable knowledge that applies across multiple books.  
Use this folder for content that is not specific to any single book.

## Contents

- **glossary.md**  
  Definitions of common technical terms and concepts.

- **concepts.md**  
  Explanations of fundamental ideas that appear across multiple books.

- **interview-questions.md**  
  System design or technical questions inspired by the books.

- **diagrams/**  
  A folder containing architecture diagrams, flow charts, or visual explanations.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Only add content here if it is general and not tied to a single book.
- Keep definitions and explanations short and clear.
- Diagrams should be placed inside `shared/diagrams/`.
- When adding a new term or concept, ensure it does not already exist.
